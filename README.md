# MySpending
My Project for mid test on semester 4

We need to create a simple spending list app where you can add, view, and edit data about user's spending. The data will be stored into a local database. The data for each spending list is an ID, name, nominal, and created date.

For this project, i used recycler view to list all the spending. For the database, i used SQLite. Even though its not required, i still add a delete button to delete each spending data from the list and database.
